                Heroes are the essential element of Dota 2, as the course of the match is 
                dependent on their intervention. During a match, two opposing teams select 
                five out of 120 heroes that accumulate experience and gold to grow stronger 
                and gain new abilities in order to destroy the opponent's Ancient. Most heroes 
                have a distinct role that defines how they affect the battlefield, though many 
                heroes can perform multiple roles. A hero's appearance can be modified with equipment.

                Heroes have one of three primary attributes: Strength, Agility, and Intelligence. 
                Every point added to a hero's primary attribute increases that hero's attack damage.

            <p>
                Strength heroes are tough warriors and can withstand more damage than other heroes. These 
                heroes have the greatest natural health and can regenerate quickly, keeping them in the fight 
                and dealing damage. Strength heroes can fit a variety of roles, with many being initiators or 
                heavy disablers, and are almost always melee heroes.

            <p>Some strength heroes are:</p>

                <li>Axe</li>
                <li>Centaur Warrunner</li>

        <section class="main-section" id="Agility_heroes">
            <header>Agility heroes</header>
            <p>
                Agility heroes are finessed and dexterous, making them masters of weapons and fighting techniques. 
                These heroes have high attack speed and armor, and focus on using their regular attacks in conjunction 
                with the items they have equipped, but can fall back on their abilities in a pinch. Agility heroes are 
                often played in carry and ganker roles, because of how well they scale.

            <p>Some Agility heroes are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Anti-mage</li>
                <li>Morphling</li>
                <li>Ember Spirit</li>

        <section class="main-section" id="Intelligence_heroes">
            <header>Intelligence heroes</header>
            <p>
                Intelligence heroes are masters of spells and abilities. They tend to have larger mana pools and much greater mana 
                regeneration than other heroes. Because of this, they often rely on their abilities to help allies and harm enemies 
                rather than physical attacks, although some of them utilize their magical powers to heavily enhance their attack 
                capabilities. Most intelligence heroes are fragile ranged heroes, though this does not necessarily mean they are easy 
                to kill. As a result, they are often played in support, ganker, and pusher roles, while some are played as carries.

                The main objective in Dota 2 is to destroy the enemy Ancient Structure inside their stronghold, these strongholds are 
                protected by multiple towers down 3 lanes. The player controls a Hero which fights for them and gains strength by leveling 
                up by getting experience, which is given when creeps and heroes die, and by itemization by buying items with gold.
